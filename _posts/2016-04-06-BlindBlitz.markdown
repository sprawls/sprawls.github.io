A party game using both the computer and a real hand-crafted deck of cards. 

A selection of prompt appear on screen and each player has a card which represent a specific input. If the input on the player's card is pressed, each other player makes points. The twist is, no player know their own card and the only player with a controller cannot see the screen. 

It is up to the players to guide, convince or deceive each other to win.
