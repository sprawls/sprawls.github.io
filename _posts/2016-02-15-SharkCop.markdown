Follow shark cop on a normal day at work. Fill paperwork, harass commissioner Pencil Washington, get Starlin back in jail and harm over a hundred fish in the process !

This game was made for the Indies vs Gamers jam where the winning game was to be played by a few famous youtubers. Despite not winning, the game still managed to reach over 100k views on Youtube.
